## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
### Week 0: The Setup
# Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new?;
Nothing has super clicked for me just yet, everything in javascript is new to me.-->
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense?
The new terminology in Java, and adding another location for my code information. Nothing really makes sense just yet. I am going through the motions but nothing is sticking-->
​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help?
I used both, Copilot to be my small error fix, like spell check for code. Why a link wasn't working and i missed a dash or something like that. I used Chat to help make a better structured plan for each assignment and to help make some base Html and Css code so my brain could focus on learning the new language (Java)-->
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? 
A little bit of everything, i need more time in class with SLOW tutorials. Guieded repetition is how i learn-->
