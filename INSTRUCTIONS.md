# Welcome to DESN 378: Code + Design 2

Also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**)

This template is your workspace for the quarter. By the end, it becomes your portfolio.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Repository

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
2. Name it: `**DESN378-code-design-2**'
3. Set to **Public**

### Step 2: Set Up Your Profiles (All Must Match)

- Fill out `PROFILE.md` with your info
- Update **ALL** your profiles to match:
  - **GitHub** — Name, photo, bio
  - **Figma** — Same name, same photo
  - **CodePen** — Same name, same photo
- Same name. Same photo. Consistent presence.
- See the checklist in `PROFILE.md` to track your progress.

### Step 3: Replace This README

1. Click on `README.md` in your repo
2. Click the **pencil icon** (edit)
3. Change the filename from `README.md` to `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**
5. Back in your repo, click **Add file** → **Create new file**
6. Name it `README.md`
7. Copy the template from **Section 4** in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
8. Paste and update placeholders with your info
9. Commit changes

Your portfolio README is now the front page. Setup guide lives in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

### Step 4: Your Workspace Is Ready

The starter files are already set up:

```
index.html          ← Your Learning Log will grow here
css/styles.css      ← Your styles
scripts/main.js     ← Your JavaScript (starts Week 1)
```

Your `index.html` will evolve week by week as you learn. By the end of the quarter, we will update it and the repo becomes your portfolio.

**What about your DESN 368 portfolio?**
Keep it where it is for now. We'll address portfolio consolidation later in the quarter. This weekend, you'll do a peer audit to assess the current state of your work.

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from branch** → **main** → **/ (root)**
3. Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

### Step 6: Add Your Live Link

At the top of your new README, add the link to your live portfolio:

```markdown
🔗 **[Learning Log](https://yourusername.github.io/this repo-name)**
🔗 **[DESN368 Portfolio](https://yourusername.github.io/desn368-portfolio-repo)**
```

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not deploying

1. Check Settings → Pages → Source is set to "main" branch
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment

4. Make sure `index.html` is in the root (not in a subfolder)

### Student benefits expired

1. Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/benefits)
2. Re-verify with your @ewu.edu email
3. Benefits usually renew within 24-48 hours
