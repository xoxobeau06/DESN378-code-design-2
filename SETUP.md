- Check expiration date
- Reapply with current student ID + EagleNet screenshot
- Takes 1-3 days to process

**Figma says "Starter" not "Education"?**
- Log out, log back in
- Check if your @ewu.edu email is verified
- Reapply if needed

**Copilot not suggesting anything?**
- Check VS Code extension is installed
- Check you're signed into GitHub in VS Code
- Check your Student Pack includes Copilot access

**Can't enable GitHub Pages?**
- Make sure repo is public
- Make sure there's at least one file (like this README)
