                <h1>Tiny wins -- Big Feelings</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">A soft and honest look at what I learned, what confused me, what I wrestled with, and the small progress that kept me moving, even when nothing felt fully "clicked" yet.</p>

                <h2>The Threshold</h2>
                <p>There wasn't a dramatic "light bulb moment," but I did have small sparks where things began to make sense. Each time something I coded finally appeared on the screen the way I intended, it felt like proof that I could figure this out, even if it took time. Those tiny moments of alignment made coding feel less like chaos and more like something I could work with. Progress showed up slowly, but it showed up.</p>

                <h2>The Pit</h2>
                <p>The hardest part of this course was how fast everything moved. I'm the kind of learner who needs time to sit with new information, experiment with it (and fail) a few times before it sticks, and I didn't always have that time. There were weeks where it felt like I was sprinting just to stay close to the group. Even in the overwhelm, I kept showing up, kept practicing, and kept reminding myself that learning something new isn't instant, it's layered.</p>

            <section class="reflection-section">
                <h2>The Pivot</h2>
                <p>My original mood board was full of ideas, colors, textures, styles, and aesthetics I loved. It felt dreamy, but also a little chaotic. As I began building my actual site, I had to narrow things down and commit to a clearer visual direction. The final design still feels like me, just... edited. Softer, more intentional, and grounded in what works in a real digital space.</p>

            <section class="reflection-section">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>If I could redo the quarter, I'd give myself more time to study the code itself, not just use it, but understand it. I would slow down (even when the course felt fast) and make space to read documentation, experiment more, and ask more questions earlier. I learned that coding isn't just about getting it to work, it's about understanding why it works.</p>

                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>This course helped me start bridging the gap between being a designer and becoming someone who can also build the things she designs. Even though I'm still learning and don't feel fluent yet, I now see web code as another creative tool, not something separate from design. As I keep practicing, I think this hybrid skillset will help me create more intentional work and communicate better with developers in the future. It feels like the beginning of a skill I'll grow into, not the end of one.</p>
